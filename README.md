# Registration Form  
Using Node.js and Express Framework, I have built a simple registration form with simple HTTP authentication with MongoDB database.  
This app consist of view that lists successful registrations and Bootstrap is used for styling.  
Only basic functions have been added till now.  
Run the following command and then go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  
>npm run watch  

To access the list of all registrations create a file named user.htpasswd and in it enter your username and password in format <username\>:<password\>.   
Then go to [localhost:8080/registrations](http://localhost:8080/registrations)
