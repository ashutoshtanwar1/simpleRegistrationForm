# Registration Form  
Using Node.js and Express Framework, I have built a simple registration form with simple HTTP authentication with MongoDB database.  
This app consist of view that lists successful registrations and Bootstrap is used for styling.  
Only basic functions have been added till now.  
Run the following command and then go to localhost:8080  
>npm run watch
